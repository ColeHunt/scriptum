## Summary

| Component | Version | License | Where it ships |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope) (**modified**) | v26.0.2 | BSD-3-Clause | AS Lite assets compiled into the control image |
| [Choreo](https://github.com/SleipnirGroup/Choreo) (**modified**) | commit `6eccc5a` | BSD-3-Clause | web frontend compiled into the control image; `choreo-server` sidecar compiled into the workspace image |
| [Elastic Dashboard](https://github.com/Gold872/elastic_dashboard) (**modified**) | v2026.1.2 | MIT | web assets bundled into the control image |
| [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) / Code – OSS (**modified**) | 1.126.04524 | MIT | `reh-web` build, base of the workspace image |
| [linuxserver/vscodium-web](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-vscodium-web) image | 1.126.04524-ls35 | GPL-3.0 | base image, unmodified |
| [Eclipse Temurin JDK](https://adoptium.net/) | 17.0.15+6 and 21.0.12.1+1 | GPL-2.0 with Classpath Exception | project/simulation and JDT LS runtimes in the workspace image |
| [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib) | 2026 | BSD-3-Clause | jars primed into the workspace image's Gradle cache |
| [vscode-wpilib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/vscode-wpilib) | 2026.1.1 | BSD-3-Clause | extension bundled in the workspace image |
| [AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit) | — | BSD-3-Clause | referenced by the bundled `robot-starter` lesson |
| [redhat.java](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java) | 1.55.0 | EPL-2.0 | extension bundled in the workspace image |
| [vscjava.\*](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack) Java extensions | see Dockerfile | MIT | extensions bundled in the workspace image |
| [vscode-spotless-gradle](https://github.com/badsyntax/vscode-spotless-gradle) | 1.2.1 | MIT | extension bundled in the workspace image |

Exact pinned versions live in [`vendor/tools.json`](./vendor/tools.json) (AdvantageScope,
Elastic Dashboard, Choreo), [`containers/code/Dockerfile`](./containers/code/Dockerfile)
(everything else in the workspace image), and [`.gitmodules`](./.gitmodules). Runtime npm
dependencies carry their own licenses, listed in `bun.lock` and the respective
`package.json` files. AdvantageScope ships its own aggregated dependency license list as
`ThirdPartyLicenses.txt` alongside the AS Lite bundle. The Elastic Dashboard web bundle
includes Flutter's generated dependency notices at `assets/NOTICES`.

## Modifications

CodeRunner redistributes a **modified** build of AdvantageScope. The patch is kept at
source level in [`patches/advantagescope/001-lite-nt4-endpoint-injection.patch`](./patches/advantagescope/)
and injects an NT4 endpoint so AS Lite can run embedded in the CodeRunner page
(`/scope/?frcEndpoint=postMessage`).

CodeRunner also redistributes a **modified** build of Choreo. The patches
are kept at source level in
[`patches/choreo/`](./patches/choreo/) (five patches, applied in order) and
add, most notably, a `choreo-server` HTTP/WS sidecar replacing Choreo's
native Tauri IPC boundary, and a frontend ported to talk to it instead. See
[decision 045](https://github.com/mathewdunne/CodeRunner/blob/main/docs/decisions/045-choreo-submodule-migration.md)
for the full list of changes.

CodeRunner also redistributes a **modified** build of Elastic Dashboard. The
patch is kept at source level in
[`patches/elastic/001-coderunner-integration.patch`](./patches/elastic/) and
adds embedded-mode NT4 endpoint injection and layout persistence to the
student's project (`/elastic/?ws=<slug>`).

CodeRunner also redistributes a **modified** VSCodium `reh-web` build. The
workspace image rewrites the stale VS Code revision in
`webviewContentExternalBaseUrlTemplate` — in `product.json` and in the compiled
`out/` where VSCodium inlines it — to the revision VSCodium 1.126 was actually
built from, so extension webviews can load their local assets. The edit is a
single revision string, applied in `containers/code/Dockerfile`; see
[`docs/decisions/036-vscodium-web-migration.md`](./docs/decisions/036-vscodium-web-migration.md).
The GPL-3.0 `linuxserver/vscodium-web` layer itself is unmodified.

No other bundled component is modified.

## Components under copyleft licenses

These ship unmodified inside the workspace container image and are not linked into or
derived from CodeRunner's own code. Their full license texts are distributed with the
components themselves and are available upstream:

- **`linuxserver/vscodium-web` container image** — GNU General Public License v3.0.
  <https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-vscodium-web/blob/main/LICENSE>
- **Eclipse Temurin JDK 17 and 21** — GNU General Public License v2.0 with the Classpath
  Exception, which explicitly permits linking independent modules.
  <https://openjdk.org/legal/gplv2+ce.html>
- **`redhat.java` (Language Support for Java by Red Hat)** — Eclipse Public License 2.0.
  <https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/blob/master/LICENSE>

## Extension artifact sourcing

`vscode-spotless-gradle` is not published to Open VSX and its publisher does
not attach VSIX artifacts to GitHub releases. The workspace image therefore
builds version 1.2.1 from the publisher's pinned MIT-licensed source commit in
a throwaway Docker stage. No Visual Studio Marketplace artifact is downloaded
or redistributed.
