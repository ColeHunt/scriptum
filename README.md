# CodeRunner

A self-hosted, browser-based IDE for learning FRC robot programming. Students get a hosted VS Code editor, isolated Docker workspaces, one-click robot simulation, live AdvantageScope/Elastic Dashboard telemetry, and a Choreo path/auto editor — all with no local setup. Lesson modules guide beginners, while GitHub team import supports real robot projects.

## Quick Start

Try CodeRunner locally in demo mode — no Legion setup, no configuration required. Just Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathewdunne/CodeRunner coderunner
cd coderunner
CODERUNNER_DEMO_MODE=1 docker compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). You land directly in the IDE as a single seeded admin user.

**Prerequisites:** Docker with the Compose plugin (running). No Bun, Flutter, submodules, or emscripten needed — the control image ships the web shell, AdvantageScope, and Choreo assets prebuilt (Elastic Dashboard too, if the published image was built with it — see [decision 041](docs/decisions/041-elastic-dashboard-integration.md)). On macOS and native Windows there is nothing to configure; on **Linux and WSL2** (Docker Desktop's WSL2 integration included) the socket belongs to the `docker` group, so prefix the command with `CODERUNNER_DOCKER_GID=$(stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock)` or set that variable in `.env`.

> **Warning:** Demo mode bypasses authentication entirely. Every visitor shares the same admin user and workspace. Do not expose a demo instance to the public internet. See [docs/quick-start.md](docs/quick-start.md) for full details and next steps.

## Documentation

Documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/) and is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) from [`website/`](website/). To browse locally:

```bash
cd website && bun install && bun run start
```

Or from the repo root:

```bash
bun run docs:dev
```

## Development

Start the control plane and web shell in parallel:

```bash
bun run dev:control   # Bun control plane on :4000 with --watch
bun run dev:web       # Vite web shell on :5173 with HMR
```

Run the full verification suite before submitting changes:

```bash
bun run verify        # typecheck + Bun tests + Vitest + Playwright
```

See [docs/development/dev-servers.md](docs/development/dev-servers.md) for the full development workflow.
