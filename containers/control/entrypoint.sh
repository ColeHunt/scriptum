# fabrica — dispatching CLI entrypoint for the control-plane image.
#
# Installed at /usr/local/bin/fabrica by the Dockerfile. Reached two ways:
#   1. As the image ENTRYPOINT: `docker compose run --rm control <subcommand>`
#      (CMD defaults to "serve", so a bare `docker compose up`/`run` boots the
#      server; `run --rm control backup` etc. replace CMD with a subcommand).
#   2. Directly on PATH inside a running container: `docker compose exec
#      control fabrica <subcommand>` — `exec` bypasses the image
#      ENTRYPOINT entirely, so this form only works because the script is
#      also installed as a normal executable on PATH, not because it's the
#      ENTRYPOINT.
#
# Every branch below `exec`s into `bun` (or, for the passthrough case, the
# given command), replacing this shell as PID 1 so signals from `docker stop`
# go straight to the real process.

Usage: fabrica <subcommand> [args...]

Subcommands:
  serve                    Run pending DB migrations, then start the control plane (default).
  backup [args]            Back up the database and workspace projects.
  restore <dir> [args]     Restore state from a backup created by `backup`.
  users <cmd> [args]       List users (roles come from Legion group membership).
  audit-prune [args]       Prune audit log entries older than a given date.
  rebuild-workspaces       Remove managed workspace containers and clear their leases.
  cleanup [args]           Remove stopped managed containers.
  migrate [apply|status]   Run or check the status of database migrations.
  help                     Show this message.

Anything else is exec'd as-is, e.g. `fabrica bash` for a shell.
