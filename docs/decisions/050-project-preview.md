# 050 — Project Preview (Markdown + generated HTML reports)

Status: **Accepted** — 2026-09-12

## Context

Students need to read their project's own documents beside the editor:
lesson instructions in `README.md`, and the HTML reports Gradle generates
under `build/reports/**`. VSCodium's built-in Markdown preview is not an
option — decision 036 records that VSCodium webviews load from
`vscode-cdn.net`, which breaks on a locked-down school network and cannot
be framed by the control plane. A CDN-hosted renderer has the same problem.

A generated Gradle report is not a single file. It is a tree of pages that
link to each other and pull in their own `css/`, `js/` and `img/` siblings
by relative URL. Anything that serves only one file at a time renders it
unstyled and inert, so the delivery model had to be settled before any UI
was built on top of it.

## The blocking constraint we found first

Project HTML is executable, student-authored content. Framing it with
`sandbox="allow-scripts"` and **without** `allow-same-origin` is what keeps
a report's scripts away from the CodeRunner shell — but that same choice
gives the framed document an **opaque origin**, and a browser computes a
null site-for-cookies for an opaque origin. The `SameSite=Lax` session
cookie is therefore dropped from everything the frame requests.

Measured in Chromium against a local server before committing to a design:

| Request | Session cookie |
| --- | --- |
| Top-level page | sent |
| Iframe document (parent-initiated navigation) | sent |
| Stylesheet / script / image from inside the frame | **not sent** |
| Link navigation inside the frame | **not sent** |

So "authenticate every preview request with the session cookie" and "deny
the frame same-origin privileges" are mutually exclusive. Serving the whole
report from a second origin would resolve it properly, but costs a DNS
name, a Caddy vhost, certificate coverage and deploy changes.

## Decision

- **A signed path token carries the grant.** `GET /u/:slug/api/preview/documents`
  stays behind `requireWorkspaceOwnership` (an ordinary same-origin fetch
  from the shell, so the cookie is present) and returns the document list
  plus a token. Resources are then served from
  `GET /u/:slug/api/preview/files/<token>/<path>`. Because a report's links
  are relative, the browser rebuilds every follow-up URL from the current
  one and the token segment is inherited automatically — the report needs
  to know nothing about it.
  - The token is `HMAC-SHA256(sessionSecret, "coderunner.preview.v1.<workspaceId>.<exp>")`,
    base64url, with a 15-minute TTL. The workspace id is inside the signed
    message, so one student's token does not verify against another
    student's slug.
  - This is the **only** workspace route dispatched ahead of the cookie
    ownership check, and it is read-only and GET-only. `workspace-routes.ts`
    carries a comment saying so, because the exception is otherwise
    indistinguishable from a mistake.
  - Cost accepted: a capability in a URL. Mitigated by the short TTL,
    `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, and `Cache-Control: no-store, private`.
    Capability-bearing request paths are redacted from structured HTTP logs.
    It authorises exactly the tree its owner could already read.
- **Isolation is applied twice.** The iframe carries
  `sandbox="allow-scripts"`, and every document response repeats the policy
  as a `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox …` header, so opening a report URL
  directly is isolated the same way. `'self'` is useless in a CSP for an
  opaque-origin document — it matches nothing — so resource directives name
  the response's own token-scoped path prefix instead. `connect-src`,
  `form-action`, `frame-src`, `worker-src` and `object-src` are `'none'`.
  `navigate-to 'none'` adds best-effort protection against scripted
  navigation exporting the capability URL.
  Markdown gets the stricter variant with no `allow-scripts` at all.
  Directly navigable SVG assets get document isolation too.
- **Markdown renders in-process** with `markdown-it` (`html: false`),
  local CSS and system fonts. Headings get stable slugs so hand-written
  `#anchor` links resolve. No CDN, webfont, or highlighting bundle.
- **HTML reports are served byte-for-byte**, with a narrow MIME allowlist
  for their assets (CSS, classic JS, common images including SVG, fonts).
  Source and config files beside a report are refused with 415 — this
  handler must not become a way to read a project's files back out through
  the browser.
- **Discovery is bounded and honest**: 2,000 documents, 20,000 visited
  entries, depth 32, 10 MiB per document, 25 MiB per asset. The walk is
  breadth-first so a budget leaves a shallow, useful listing. Hitting one
  sets `truncated: true`, which the picker shows.
- **`.git`, `.gradle` and `node_modules` are excluded by name**; other
  dot-directories are not, because hand-written docs live in them.
  `.gitignore` is deliberately *not* the filter — `build/reports/**` is
  gitignored and is exactly what students need.
- **Symlinks are refused** on both the walk and the read, and the file
  actually opened is verified through `/proc/self/fd` before its bytes are
  used, closing the check-then-use race on a tree the student can write to.
- **UI**: this fork's workbench is independently-toggleable panes (not a
  tab switcher, unlike upstream) - Preview is a fifth pane alongside
  AdvantageScope/Choreo/Elastic, shown or hidden with its own topbar toggle,
  and can be visible at the same time as any of them. All panes stay
  mounted regardless of toggle state, so Preview's document list fetches as
  soon as the workspace loads rather than waiting for a first activation.
  Refresh re-reads the list *and* remounts the frame with a fresh token,
  which is what forces the document's CSS, scripts and images to be
  re-fetched; it starts the document at the top. There is no watcher, poll,
  post-run trigger, or scroll restoration.
- **Console (`plain-java`) lessons get Preview too**, via a standalone
  show/hide button in the topbar (`Topbar`'s `showPreviewToggle`), since
  they have no other panes to toggle. `IDELayout` renders a small
  editor/Preview split for these lessons instead of the full workbench.

## Tested compatibility boundary

Proven in a real browser (`e2e/specs/preview/delivery.spec.ts`) against a
Gradle-shaped report fixture: local stylesheet applied, classic script ran
and stayed interactive, local image decoded, page-to-page navigation in
both directions including parent-relative asset references, and Markdown
rendering with all off-origin requests blocked. Isolation is asserted
directly: opaque origin, parent DOM blocked, `localStorage` blocked,
authenticated API calls blocked.

Outside the boundary, and expected to need later work if it ever comes up:
reports needing remote CDNs, a backend API, ES modules with cross-origin
requirements, or browser storage. Externally hosted images in a Markdown
file are not made to work offline by this feature.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Add `allow-same-origin`.** Restores cookie auth, but hands report
  scripts the shell's origin: authenticated API calls, app storage, parent
  DOM. Fails the isolation requirement outright.
- **A `SameSite=None; Secure` preview cookie.** Browsers require `Secure`,
  which breaks plain-http local dev and the demo stack, and the cookie then
  rides along on any cross-site request to the app.
- **A second origin for preview.** The right long-term answer and still
  open to us, but it costs DNS, a Caddy vhost, certificates and deploy
  changes, and still needs a cross-origin token handoff.
- **Inlining assets into one document.** Cannot represent a multi-page
  report tree.

## Consequences

- One new dependency (`markdown-it`) in the control plane.
- `apps/control/src/app/assets.ts` gains `isOpenFileInsideRoot`, the
  descriptor-verification helper. `deploy-files.ts` keeps its own private
  copy; it was not refactored, per the surgical-changes rule.
- `/u/:slug/api/preview/files/*` is templated in `metrics.ts` so neither
  the token nor a project path can become a metric label.
