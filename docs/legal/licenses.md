# Licenses

CodeRunner is released under the **MIT License**. It redistributes third-party software that
remains under its own terms.

This page is a summary. The authoritative, complete notices — including the full license
texts the BSD-3-Clause components require — are in
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](https://github.com/mathewdunne/CodeRunner/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
in the repository, and ship inside both container images at `/usr/share/coderunner/`.

None of the projects, organizations, or individuals listed below endorse or are affiliated
with CodeRunner.

Exact pinned versions are in
[`vendor/tools.json`](https://github.com/mathewdunne/CodeRunner/blob/main/vendor/tools.json)
(AdvantageScope, Choreo, Elastic Dashboard) and
[`containers/code/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/mathewdunne/CodeRunner/blob/main/containers/code/Dockerfile)
(everything else). AdvantageScope ships its own aggregated dependency license list as
`ThirdPartyLicenses.txt` alongside the bundled telemetry view. Elastic Dashboard ships
Flutter's generated dependency notices as `assets/NOTICES`.

## Modifications

CodeRunner redistributes a **modified** build of AdvantageScope. The change is kept as a
source-level patch in
[`patches/advantagescope/`](https://github.com/mathewdunne/CodeRunner/tree/main/patches/advantagescope)
and injects an NT4 endpoint so the telemetry view can run embedded in the CodeRunner page.

CodeRunner also redistributes Choreo's web frontend and `choreo-server` sidecar from the
[`ColeHunt/Choreo`](https://github.com/ColeHunt/Choreo) fork, pinned to a specific commit.
Unlike AdvantageScope and Elastic Dashboard, no source patch is applied — the fork is built
as-is, and embedding support lives entirely in CodeRunner's own proxy/routing code.

CodeRunner also redistributes a **modified** build of Elastic Dashboard. The change is kept
as a source-level patch in
[`patches/elastic/`](https://github.com/mathewdunne/CodeRunner/tree/main/patches/elastic)
and adds embedded-mode NT4 endpoint injection and layout persistence to the student's
project.

The workspace image also ships a **modified** VSCodium build: it rewrites one stale VS Code
revision string in the editor's webview configuration so extension webviews can load their
local assets. The GPL-3.0 `linuxserver/vscodium-web` layer itself is unmodified.

No other bundled component is modified.

## What this means for you

- **Running an instance.** Self-hosting CodeRunner for your team requires nothing beyond
  keeping the license files intact.
- **Forking or redistributing.** Keep `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` with the copy you
  distribute. The BSD-3-Clause components require their copyright notice, conditions, and
  disclaimer to travel with both source and binary redistributions — including container
  images.
- **Naming.** The BSD-3-Clause components carry a no-endorsement clause. You may describe
  AdvantageScope, Choreo, WPILib, or AdvantageKit factually as components you bundle, but may
  not use the names of Littleton Robotics, FRC 6328, Choreo's copyright holders, FIRST, WPILib,
  or their contributors to promote a derived product without written permission.

## Lesson content

Bundled lesson modules under `catalog/` include their own license files where the starter code
derives from upstream projects — for example
`catalog/modules/robot-starter/WPILib-License.md` and `AdvantageKit-License.md`. Lessons you
author or import carry whatever license you give them.
